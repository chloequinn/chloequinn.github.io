(They don't take reservations, so expect to put your name on the list and then go get a drink across the street at the Peacock Lounge.) The short, affordable menu - nothing costs more than $10 - consists of the hearty, traditional fare that two of the owners, Irish expats, grew up on, right down to the baby-food-style mushy peas. The fish and chips are crispy but mild--for more flavor go with the mashed-potato-frosted Shepherd's Pie or the fried-egg-and-ham-topped Helicopter Burger.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/the-anchor-fish-and-chips-minneapolis-st-paul-2509924-l/"],
			["Restaurant $",44.93971,-93.288415,"El Meson","Chef Hector Ruiz and his wife Erin Ungerman have made this casual eatery a favorite of south Minneapolis residents. In the winter, the covered booths are so cozy and colorful they'll almost make you forget it's cold and gray outside, and in the summer, the popular outdoor seating is a reminder of why we tolerate our winters. The restaurant's Sunday through Thursday happy hour is a boon for carnivores and vegetarians alike: The menu features refreshingly adventurous snacks such as sherry-glazed chorizo and seared saffron scallops, alongside roasted mushrooms, tangy olives, and baked brie served with an apple-cider apricot sauce.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/el-meson-minneapolis-st-paul-2517358-l/"],

They've brought neighborhood-friendly dining back to the Johnson Street space vacated by the dearly departed Pop, a contemporary take on the small-town café. Their menu of comfort foods with modern twists reflects its intergenerational patrons, a mix of old-timers and young families. They call its formula 'one part grandma, one part grandson.' For grandma there's a turkey commercial and a remake of Pop's beloved Swedish meatballs. For grandson, there are deep-fried, cream cheese-stuffed olives, pork loin with green apple/ginger sauce, and banana French toast smothered in caramel.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/hazels-northeast-minneapolis-st-paul-2967832-l/"],

Ever-ready midnight or late-breakfast pizza slices with artichokes next to a good beer is as good a definition as any, so hallelujah for these beloved Minneapolis gems. It's just icing on the cake that at the Lucés beer is served as often as not by someone who looks like they just came back from touring with GWARcosmopolitan squared! All four restaurants (with a fifth in Duluth) serve up a crisp crust, potent red sauce, and more toppings than you can shake an antipasto at: Calamata olives, roasted red peppers, homemade sausage, barbecued chicken, and spicy mock duck, to name a very few.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/pizza-luce-minneapolis-st-paul-2514344-l/"],

Chef Paul Berglund has also managed to breathe new life into the cuisine that many Minnesotans were first introduced to by their Scandinavian grandmothers. Cured salmon, softly spiced meatballs made with milk-soaked breadcrumbs and begging to be dunked in tart lingonberry sauce","http://www.voiceplaces.com/the-bachelor-farmer-minneapolis-st-paul-4390416-l/"],
			["Restaurant $",44.924611,-93.314728,"Zumbro to Go","Many of our best thinkers have concluded that the true work of adulthood is the raising of children. Obviously enough, if you can hook up that noble goal in a Victorian home with a porch swing in halcyon Linden Hills, you are doing all right. And then you will be making snacks, wrangling sneakers, and packing backpacks for the betterment of mankind, until you are ready to scream. That is when it is time to arrange a playdate for the little ones and head to Zumbro, for the kind of high-class comfort food that feeds the body and soul. The room is sunshiney, the staff sweet, the coffee hot and good.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/zumbro-to-go-minneapolis-st-paul-2521236-l/"],
			["Restaurant $",44.970985,-93.247072,"Acadia Cafe","Ever since they moved into their current location at Cedar & Riverside on Minneapolis' West Bank, the Acadia has made itself a welcome presence in a neighborhood with no shortage of great bars. Part of that owes to the club's bountiful beer selection, with more than two dozen tap brews and more than 40 bottle beers to choose from. Less-thirsty patrons, meanwhile, congregate there for their frequent no-cover shows, which run the gamut from rock to folk to experimental music.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/acadia-cafe-minneapolis-st-paul-2427942-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.933944,-93.278155,"Blackbird","This husband-and-wife's labor of love has a decor--mismatched mirrors and an extensive antler collection--as eclectic as its menu. After a fire destroyed the original location, the owners reopened in bigger, sunnier digs, but retained its neighborhood hospitality and many of its clientele's favorite dishes. Though nearly everything on the menu might be classified as gourmet comfort food, the list avoids the slider trios and panko-crusted mac and cheeses that have made the trend feel clichéd. Blackbird's fare manages to seem familiar while featuring dishes that are rarely if ever seen on local menus.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/blackbird-minneapolis-st-paul-2968804-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.924662,-93.314074,"Tilia","After a career working for several of the Twin Cities' most notable restaurateurs and running some seriously ambitious kitchens at Restaurant Levain and Porter & Frye, chef Steven Brown finally has his own digs. To retain an accessible vibe, his 14-table Tilia doesn't take reservations, so you could easily wait for an hour on the weekend, but the restaurant is a pretty enough place to wait, with its wooden booths, denim-upholstered chairs, and retro light fixtures. It's a worldview filtered through the iPhone's Hipstamatic camera app, and, in a way, Tilia feels like it's been here forever.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/tilia-minneapolis-st-paul-4281066-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.955697,-93.27766,"The Bad Waitress","Pancakes have certain curative powers: to quell hunger, to soothe a broken heart over a gossipy brunch, and to help soak up the toxins from a legendary evening. They hold within their tenderly crusted surfaces a warm, buttery center of comfort that recalls one's childhood security blanket. For your money, the most reliably tasty pancakes are found at the hipster diner the Bad Waitress. One can certainly find fancier pancakes around town-more creative, more organic, more traditional-but none are more consistent and substantial than those at the Bad. These breakfast miracles are a weekly staple for many patrons, and their seasonal pancake recipes are especially noteworthy.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/the-bad-waitress-minneapolis-st-paul-2520805-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.949469,-93.296089,"Bar Abilene","If you mix them, they will come! Bar Abilene has proved this, building an almost cult-like following with their 16-ounce margaritas made with fresh juices and top-shelf tequilas. Truly, people drive in from the farthest corners of the metro area for these jewel-bright drinks made from some 90 tequilas and 30 juices. All hail the beauty of fresh squeezed lime! The kitchen produces some clean, fresh, slightly elevated versions of Mexican favorites. The guacamole is made before your eyes, at tableside, and because of that it's as fresh and good as possible. The chili, made with sirloin steak and black beans, is both rib-sticking and sophisticated.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/bar-abilene-minneapolis-st-paul-2510467-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.962763,-93.242683,"Blue Nile Ethiopian Restaurant","Modern humans evolved in Ethiopia, but what did our distant ancestors eat? Possibly something like injera, a fermented flatbread made from one of the earliest cultivated grains, called teff. At the Blue Nile, a large restaurant that often has live music and dancing in the attached bar, a big injera arrives at your table bearing ladles of stew; raafuu, for instance, a kale-carrot blend, or maraka lukuu, chicken on the bone in a thick, rich tomato-laced butter sauce. Order a sampler platter, and you'll get most of the best items on the menu at minimal expense.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/blue-nile-ethiopian-restaurant-minneapolis-st-paul-2513641-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.949106,-93.298278,"Chino Latino","If you're a hot enough country, you're cool enough to have your cuisine represented at red-hot Chino Latino-Mexico, Thailand, Jamaica, Polynesia, Korea, take a bow, you're in! And if you're hot enough to sip powerful, fruity, yummy drinks in a dazzling sort of red-toned Blade Runner sequel of a restaurant, look no further than this two-level style palace. The best dishes on the ever-changing menu tend to be the oversize appetizers dubbed 'little dishes to share': Look particularly for mussels, any sort of ceviche, and sushi-grade tuna preparations. Among the big dishes to share, which generally feed three or four people, standouts include the roast cuy, or guinea pig","http://www.voiceplaces.com/chino-latino-minneapolis-st-paul-2516274-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.979756,-93.236404,"Loring Pasta Bar","Like a movie set, like a stage set, like a fantasy with tapestry costumes and professional lighting, the Loring Pasta Bar is inarguably one of the prettiest restaurants in the history of Twin Cities dining. Two rooms: one a long grotto of a bar made of undulating, Gaudi-like writhing snakes of brick; the other, a three-story soaring cathedral of post-Industrial Revolution romance. The food isn't much, since this was designed as a cheap, fun restaurant for penny-pinching University of Minnesota types. But put a bottle of wine on the table, and baby, Nicole Kidman never had a prettier dinner.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/loring-pasta-bar-minneapolis-st-paul-2510165-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$",44.946746,-93.298837,"Lucia's Restaurant and Wine Bar","The budget-friendly kid sister to one of the most esteemed fine-dining restaurants in Minnesota, Lucia's Bakery and Take Home is just what it sounds like: a place to get chef Lucia Watson's particular take on locally raised comfort foods, to take out. The counter-service restaurant has a dozen tables, and good, very inexpensive wines by the glass for those fortunate enough to score one of those precious seats. The treats for eating in or taking out are nigh innumerable: breads both crusty and tender, delicious little desserts, new-every-day soups, ever-changing salads. There are whole pies for celebrations, and more elaborate takeout specialties during holidays.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/lucias-restaurant-and-wine-bar-minneapolis-st-paul-2514774-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.982495,-93.271753,"112 Eatery","When Minneapolis chef Isaac Becker (formerly of D'Amico Cucina and Café Lurcat) and his wife Nancy St. Pierre (a decade in the front of the house at Cucina) opened their homey little downtown restaurant with its cozy booths, they changed the face of fine dining in Minneapolis. First, there's finally a spot for chef-created food until 1:00 a.m. on the weekend and midnight during the week. Second, there's a bacon-and-egg sandwich that will just about make your head fly off your shoulders with pure propulsive joy: a high-heat-fried, still creamy egg, sweet, chewy thick-cut bacon, white toast, a swipe of smoky harissa","http://www.voiceplaces.com/112-eatery-minneapolis-st-paul-2508417-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.948652,-93.3024,"Barbette","Barbette is an Uptown dining legend--the fries consistently win awards as the best in town, the wine list is shockingly affordable and well chosen, the food has tended to showcase fine-dining sourcing at everyday prices. Seriously, this has long been the place wine and dining professionals go when they're picking up their own checks.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/barbette-minneapolis-st-paul-2519583-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.904548,-93.30844,"Cafe Maude","Café Maude debuted in 2007 with a simple idea: Be as chic as Chanel, as hip as a San Francisco DJ, and as affordable as T.G.I.Friday's. Sound good to you? Yeah, you and everyone else in town. If you do ever get in, some of the highlights you'll find: creative cocktails; a jewel-toned room vibrating with live music or the choices of a live DJ played just loud enough to make you feel like you're at a party, but not too loud for conversation; a good wine list; exciting non-alchoholic drinks (be sure to get any birthday girls the one garnished with a marshmallow peep);","http://www.voiceplaces.com/cafe-maude-minneapolis-st-paul-2508570-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.984516,-93.267649,"Origami","Fold yourself into a chair at Origami if you want to try what many agree is the best sushi in the state, and order the omakase. What's that? It's when you establish some kind of rapport with the sushi chef, and give him carte blanche to put together a meal for you. (You can specify a price range, usually between $15 and $30 a head.) What follows will be the height of the fishy arts: cubes of tuna like dark rubies, elegant little strips of translucent horse mackerel presented sashimi style, fresh hotate (scallop) rolled in a spiral with black seaweed paper, and more, more, more.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/origami-minneapolis-st-paul-2515453-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.983938,-93.248114,"Restaurant Alma","Eat and drink enough at Alma and you'll earn a virtual master's degree in contemporary food and wine. Chef Alex Roberts, a veteran of such white-hot New York City kitchens as Bouley, Union Square Café, and the Gramercy Tavern, builds dishes around strong flavors, painstaking prep work, and classic French technique. A typical result is the Portuguese-style stew crowned with perfectly tender in-the-shell clams, buttery squares of roast chicken, and slices of zippy chorizo, all tied together with a delectable, garlic-flecked tomato broth holding bland but necessary white beans.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/restaurant-alma-minneapolis-st-paul-2516947-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.971487,-93.285518,"Cafe and Bar Lurcat","Café Lurcat and Bar Lurcat are conjoined twins covering substantial acreage halfway between Uptown and downtown on Minneapolis's beautiful Loring Park, across from the Walker Art Center's famed sculpture garden. The restaurant serves artisanal American bistro fare such as a lush salmon tartare with black mustard seeds. The wine list starts below $20, covers the globe unimpeachably, and is available in the bar as well. Actually, the bar is where the Lurcat vision really shines--and not just because of the first-rate people watching, but because crisp, golden, crusty house-made fries go great with so very many things,","http://www.voiceplaces.com/cafe-and-bar-lurcat-minneapolis-st-paul-2508656-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.919582,-93.284466,"Cafe Ena","The sister restaurant to El Meson and Indio serves Latin fusion fare in a tastefully decorated, light-filled dining room. While some of the entrees are hit-or-miss, neighbors have been known to gab for hours over glasses of wine and stellar appetizers like the queso fundido and tamales.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/cafe-ena-minneapolis-st-paul-2514826-l/"],
			["Restaurant $$$",44.990301,-93.253628,"Red Stag Supper Club","This latest venture from Kim Bartmann, proprietor of Barbette and the Bryant-Lake Bowl, is Minnesota's first LEED-certified restaurant. Fortunately, this information isn't pushed on diners: A supper club should be fun, not educational. And that convivial, old-school supper-club aura has not been lost here, despite the modern touches in the room and on the seasonal menu. The small plate menu features a pleasing chop salad with pomegranate seeds, Gruyere, and puffed wild rice. Entrees include everything from duck with house-made butternut squash ravioli to a six-ounce flatiron steak with potato puree and broccoli rabe.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/red-stag-supper-club-minneapolis-st-paul-2515581-l/"],

Well, technically not entirely naked, since there are a few vinaigrettes and sauces made of other raw vegetables, but basically, Ecopolitan is a land of raw foods. Think 'spaghetti' made of shredded zucchini, a 'living' pizza crust made of sprouted and dehydrated buckwheat, and burritos made with a 'tortilla' of a collard leaf. The salads and fresh juices are excellent, and if you're a vegetarian, grappling with food allergies,","http://www.voiceplaces.com/ecopolitan-minneapolis-st-paul-2519797-l/"],
			["Vegetarian/Vegan-Friendly Restaurant",44.957226,-93.2234,"Birchwood Cafe","From the minty-fresh, funky-Fifties dining area to the healthy, hand-hewn foods dished up from behind the cafeteria line, there's nothing about this Seward coffee shop and casual restaurant that isn't smart. Intelligent. Well-considered. Insightful, even. It's a place that embodies the idea that a healthy meal in a peaceful setting contributes significantly to serenity, and it's especially so in the summer, when you can take your pizzas, soups, sandwiches, and such out to one of the picnic tables and meditate on the blooming boulevard gardens all through the quiet neighborhood.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/birchwood-cafe-minneapolis-st-paul-2508964-l/"],

Bolting awake in the middle of the night craving something,anything new--mock pork, maybe? Mock shrimp? Mock Chateaubriand? Well, we can't help you with that last one, but Evergreen Taiwanese is fascinating, novel, and serving things you won't find anywhere else in Minnesota, from mock mandarin beef to imitation satay squid. If you've felt that other Asian restaurants don't understand your vegetarian ethics and are constantly trying to slip fish sauce into your broth, please know that at Evergreen they really get vegetarianism.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/evergreen-taiwanese-minneapolis-st-paul-2508704-l/"],

Between the colorful walls and the guys playing chess, the place feels like a neighborhood community center, except for the free condoms. There's also a box of donated clothes, and many patrons who look like they dress out of it. Despite the grit, the Hard Times fixes up honest grub, from meatless omelets to a tempeh Reuben that tastes just as good as the real thing.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/hard-times-cafe-minneapolis-st-paul-2523889-l/"],
			["Vegetarian/Vegan-Friendly Restaurant",44.944649,-93.262785,"Modern Times Cafe","Modern Times turned an iconic building into a breakfast and lunch cafe that's a literal bright spot-it's painted fluorescent green-along the historically rough-and-tumble Chicago corridor. The owners did much of the renovation work themselves, with the help of friends, and the space embraces an eclectic, DIY aesthetic: The walls look like they're on about their hundredth coat of paint and the tabletops are covered with rainbows. The café's spread is similar to that of places like the Seward Café, Triple Rock, and Hard Times, where the chef/co-owner once worked, actually, but executes the concept with more refinement and consistency than most of its brethren.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/modern-times-cafe-minneapolis-st-paul-4281028-l/"],
			["Vegetarian/Vegan-Friendly Restaurant",44.949222,-93.28767,"Muddy Waters Bar & Eatery","For years, Muddy Waters was one of Minneapolis's best-loved coffee shops, anchored to the corner of 24th and Lyndale by its iconic neon sign, or a coffee cup buoyantly floating, handle up, amidst a choppy java sea. Now it’s moved down the street, expanded into larger digs, and turned into a full-service restaurant and bar. The new space has a rustic, open feel. The front glass garage doors let the outdoors in, as do several skylights, and there's a narrow alley patio on the building's south side (that's where the neon sign ended up). It has the all-day hours of a true neighborhood hang-out,","http://www.voiceplaces.com/muddy-waters-bar-and-eatery-minneapolis-st-paul-2509189-l/"],
			["Vegetarian/Vegan-Friendly Restaurant",44.95693,-93.295769,"Namaste Cafe","Located in a converted Hennepin Avenue house, Namaste has an ambiance that's both cozier and more elegant than most south Asian eateries. Its sunny walls and sparkling hardwood floors make it an inviting spot to linger over a glass of wine or pot of chai. The restaurant trades in Nepalese cooking--dal, chaat, several curries--that tends to be lighter and fresher than most local Indian fare and offers several vegetarian and vegan options.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/namaste-cafe-minneapolis-st-paul-2513182-l/"],

First, all children should see how difficult it is to flatten yeast dough into a rectangle a yard long and then roll it up like a sweet, cinnamon-filled carpet. Second, they should see how easy it is to slice the long roll into individual portions. Third, they should see how warm and cute they are coming out of the oven. Fourth, they should smell, and memorize forever, the intoxicating perfume of sweet scratch baking. Fifth, and perhaps most important, children provide exceptionally good cover, and they rarely can finish one of the gigantic rolls by themselves.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/isles-bun-and-coffee-company-minneapolis-st-paul-2523744-l/"],

At this ambitious Kingfield bakery, that role would be filled by the shop's owner, John Kraus, who was most recently an instructor at the French Pastry School in Chicago, considered to be the nation's top pastry program. Kraus turns out canelé shaped like tiny, bronzed bundt cakes, with a lovely, caramelized crust, and a moist, spongy rum-spiked interior. He bakes Gibassier, a delicate, Provencal bread that's fragrant with anise seeds, orange peel, and olive oil.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/patisserie-46-minneapolis-st-paul-2964845-l/"],

The lemon bars are golden squares of French lemon tart, so full of butter they project a certain glowing luminescence and melt on the tongue, the crisp crust providing a sweet crunch of backbone for the rich filling. When you order this delirious bit of sunshine, the high school girl behind the counter picks it up with waxed paper and unceremoniously chucks it into a paper bag.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/a-bakers-wife-pastry-shop-minneapolis-st-paul-2510307-l/"],

What makes Butter special is its éclairs, which were introduced to the Kingfield neighborhood back when the space was Sweetski's Bakery. Their delicate pastry shells are just thick enough to hold the thing together, and not a bit more, so it rightfully stays out of the way of the lush pastry cream and swipe of dark chocolate on top.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/butter-minneapolis-st-paul-2521564-l/"],

While the cupcake's cake is uniformly excellent, what truly distinguishes the sugary treats is their frosting, mounded up in Dairy Queen cone-style lobes as tall as their bases. The portion might be a little excessive, but we won't be the first to cry uncle. The Italian meringue buttercream is positively ethereal: silky and light as whipped butter.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/cocoa-and-fig-minneapolis-st-paul-2963743-l/"],

Eventually she added a café with an emphasis on counter-service cooked-to-order delights like buoyant pancakes, chock-full-of-treats quiches, and legendarily satisfying soups (vegan, vegetarian, and rib-sticking-with-meat varieties). Then in 2001, dinner table-service debuted. Now the busy building is all things to all people: One of the best bakeries in the country, one of the best places to get a pancake on a Thursday morning,","http://www.voiceplaces.com/french-meadow-bakery-and-cafe-minneapolis-st-paul-2516036-l/"],

It's all smart, it's all stylish, and it's all wearing peg pants in gray-green tones. Well, not really, but Spyhouse is full of vintage '60s furniture and paintings of sad-eyed Mary Quant types doing the monkey.

Damn straight, Jack (sorry). And if Peace Coffee's awesome bike messengers sold doughnuts, the world would be a more perfect place. But while we wait for that minor miracle, we'll happily get ourselves and our dogs up for its Fair Trade beans and brew, now served hot and tasty at a brand spankin' new coffeehouse in the Longfellow neighborhood.

			["Coffee Shop",44.951537,-93.297864,"Uncommon Grounds","The location is a little odd: The two-story Victorian house is slightly pushed back on Hennepin Avenue, concealed within the busy, commercial strip that leads to the heart of Uptown. And the hours are a little bit inopportune: The place doesn't open until 5 p.m. on weekdays. But once the doors are open, it's clear what the fuss over Uncommon Grounds is all about. Dark red and faded emerald green walls and furniture cover the interior. Wraparound velour booths are scattered throughout the rooms that bear the original woodcarvings of what once was a rich family's country home in the late 1800s.","http://www.citypages.com/bestof/2008/award/best-coffee-house-443697/"],

Customers will more than likely be found in conversation with owner Jim Cone. He says he doesn't keep track of what sells well and nothing comes recommended because everything has his stamp of approval. The shop, which has been open for more than 30 years, offers a few fair-trade coffees, and a Guatemala Huehuetenango that is bought directly from the farmer. Almost 40 selections sit in containers below the counter, and even more are scattered about the store in glass jars.","http://www.citypages.com/bestof/2007/award/best-coffee-by-the-pound-70036/"],

The space looks mostly the same: The outsize windows are as lovely as ever, and tall-backed, olive-colored banquettes on each end of the room contribute to a slightly more formal ambiance. (Java Jack's previous collection of afternoon coffee sippers has mostly cleared out, so the vibe is less buzzing.) Favorite items include the house-made linguini topped with a tender, braised meatball the size of a tennis ball, curried vegetable pasty with kale salad, and the perfectly pillowy cream cheese frosting-topped cinnamon rolls.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/jacks-minneapolis-st-paul-2511157-l/"],

Summer handles the sweets, and Carlson, the chef at Spoonriver, handles the savory offerings, and both use many local, organic ingredients from the market. Favorite foods include the bison burger, with a gamey, peppery flavor that's tasty enough to eat undressed--but don't, the homemade condiments are too good to miss. The ribs, though impossible to eat with a plastic spork, are fantastic, as is the grilled asparagus with frothy lemon aioli.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/chef-shack-minneapolis-st-paul-2512695-l/"],

The street-only options include a hefty barbacoa burrito, soft-shell crab torta, and a Mexican-style hot dog that draws inspiration, according to the guy taking orders in the window, from a bona-fide south-of-the-border snack. Think of it as a Latin chili dog: The all-natural beef hot dog comes topped with bacon, beans, roasted poblano peppers, pico de gallo, and mustard.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/barrio-truck-minneapolis-st-paul-4388789-l/"],

The vegetarian platter features spongy injera bread rolled to look like two hot towels, plus potatoes, cabbage, greens, and spicy red lentils that leave a lingering burn. The chicken and rice is equally delicious, with its moist chunks of marinated chicken, fruity hot sauce, and yellow rice redolent with the woodsiness of rosemary and cardamom. If you need an afternoon pick-me-up to counteract the generous portions, She Royal is famous for its Ethiopian coffee.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/she-royal-deli-minneapolis-st-paul-2969480-l/"],

The vehicle, Smack Shack, which is parked in a surface lot a First Ave. and Fourth St. N., is the brainchild of Josh Thoma, best known for his with Tim McKee at La Belle Vie, Solera, and Smalley's Caribbean Barbeque.

There's better beef brisket to be found at eateries that specialize in barbecue, but Twisted Sister's has a pleasant smokiness and crisp, browned edges. The secret to the sandwich is the griddled bun and a generous squirt of sriracha mayonnaise, a.k.a. 'polygamy sauce,' owner Wesley Kaake's take on Utah's signature fry sauce. For dessert, Twisted offers four-bite wedges of frozen Chubby Girl cheesecakes--the salted caramel version dipped in dark chocolate is especially delicious.","http://www.voiceplaces.com/the-twisted-sister-house-of-hunger-minneapolis-st-paul-4390424-l/"],
